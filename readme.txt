This project is intended for functionality experimentation so the UI is kept simple.
The idea is to develop a way to interact with touch less interfaces without having to aiming.
As it can be the most difficult part of using a touch less UI,
due to the individual's varied ability to keep their hand steady.

All relevant actions have animated guide at the bottom of the page.
